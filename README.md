Common programming design patterns.

- Singleton Pattern: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

- Factory Method Pattern: Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- Abstract Factory Pattern: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- Builder Pattern: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

- Prototype Pattern: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, instead of creating new instances.

- Adapter Pattern: Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface, enabling classes to work together that couldn't otherwise due to incompatible interfaces.

- Decorator Pattern: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

- Proxy Pattern: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

- Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

- Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

- State Pattern: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

- Memento Pattern: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later without violating encapsulation.

- Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
